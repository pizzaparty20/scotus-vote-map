# scotus-vote-map
A math / CS exploration of Supreme Court voting pattern via vector spaces. :)

## Hi!

This project will try to quantify ideological splits and drifts in the SCOTUS.

Basic plan:
Download data
Make each case a 9D vector.
Cluster data.
Figure out how to handle transitions and NA's.

Tada!!
